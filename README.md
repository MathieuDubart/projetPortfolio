# Context

This is a school project for "L'Ã‰cole By CCI", located in France.
For the end of our first year, we had to create an adaptable portfolio for 11 students. Of course, we had to make it as customizable as possible for everyone, using the Dribbble API, which works quite well.

# Server and Routing

Our portfolios are hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

For routing, we used [Express](https://expressjs.com) and got this redirecting **code scheme** that we **made available for each page** of the portfolio:
```
app.get('/:name', (request, response)=>{
	let  username  =  request.params.name;
	response.redirect(username  +  '/home');
})
```

Each **username is stored in a .env file** with this scheme:
```
USERNAME='Dribbble OAuth token'
```

Using the public directory to store and use our pages on the web:
```
app.use(express.static(__dirname  +  '/public'));
```
So every time someone is entering https://our-portfolio.com/username, he's **automatically redirected to https://our-portfolio.com/username/home**, rendering the homepage.

To get every information we need, we have this code snippet:
```
app.get('/:name/home', (request, response)=>{
	let  username  =  request.params.name;
	
	if (username  ==  undefined) {
		username  =  "defaultUsername";
	}
	
	let  requestUser  =  dribbbleClient.getRequestForInformationAbout(username);
	let  requestShots  =  dribbbleClient.getRequestForShotsAbout(username);
	
	const  callback  = (dribbbleResponse, id) => {
		response.render('pages/home.ejs', dribbbleResponse);
	}
	
	dribbbleClient.fetchApiResponse([requestUser, requestShots], callback, null);
})
```
So if someone is trying to access https://our-portfolio.com/, he's **automatically redirected to the default username's homepage**.

Then, we are **getting the name written in url** and we make a **call to the Dribbble API** with the right **OAuth token** and render it on home.ejs file's that **displays the homepage through our callback**.

But it doesn't exactly work like that.

# Dribbble API calls
We have a file named **dribbbleclient.js** that only **contains a class** named 'DribbbleClient'.
**In this class**, we have **many methods** that are **used to make calls** to the Dribbble API and, afterwards, **to process them** by **removing** tags, links and **everything that is useless or annoying**.

The methods that allow us to perform this kind of process are calling an instance of **a class named 'Parser'** that is stored in a file named parser.js but we'll talk about it later.

In the DribbbleClient class, the first method is named **'getApiTokenFor'**.
It's a private method that takes on a parameter that is 'username'. Here it is:
```
#getApiTokenFor(username) {
	let  upperUsername  =  username.toUpperCase();
	if(process.env[upperUsername]) {
		const  accessToken  =  process.env[upperUsername];
		return  accessToken;
	} else {
		const  accessToken  =  process.env["defaultUsername"];
		return  accessToken;
	}
}
```
This private method is **called in two other methods** named **'getRequestForInformationAbout'** and **'getRequestForShotsAbout'**.

Those two methods are called in the routing seen above.

So, when you make a request on https://our-portfolio.com/username, the **app catches the username** and send it to those two methods. In turn they call the private method 'getApiTokenFor' that **returns the right OAuth Token** allowing those methods to ask the API for the right **user's information**.

# Parsing and using the API response
Now let's see how we parse and use the API response.
## Parsing

So now we have the API reponse. Let's parse it !

As said above, we have **a class named 'Parser'**.
In the DribbbleClient's instance, we have **a method called 'fetchApiResponse'** that calls an instance of the Parser's class.

In this Parser's instance (named 'parser'), we have got various methods. The only **three methods** called from the outside of the class are **'removeAllTags'**, **'removeAllTagsFromArray'** and **'removeAllFromShotsDesc'**.

All those three methods are chaining other parser's methods like 'removePTag', 'removeBrackets' and some more.

Once every tag of every call is removed, the **fetchApiResponse's callback sends information on the pages**:
```
callback({userInfos: dribbbleResponse[0].data,
	shotsInfos: dribbbleResponse[1].data,
	parsed_bio: parsed_bio,
	parsed_setting_desc: parsed_setting_desc,
	projectsDesc: projectsDesc,
	project_brief: project_brief,
	project_gallery_array: project_gallery_array,
	project_date: project_date,
	parsed_lab_desc: parsed_lab_desc,
	parsed_about_desc: parsed_about_desc,
	helper: helper,
}, id);
				
```
We also had **a third class**, stored in the **'helper.js'**, that **helps** us to **know** if the **string** passed as a parameter **is an url** and so an image **or** if **it's just** a string that **contains text** to correctly process information in the artworks section and in 'dribbbleClient.js'.

## Using the API reponse

Now that we got parsed information from dribbble with the use of the parser above,
We can start using them in ejs files to customize each portfolios.

Between all the information that we retreive, we dinstinguish several different categories :

* **'userInfos'** and **'shotsInfos'** which are the direct responses to **api calls** 'GET /user/user' and 'GET /user/shots' respectively.
Our parser didn't do much on thoses, expect adding a key 'shotId' at the end of shotsInfos, which value is the ID of the current project, if we are on ProjectPage.
	* in **userInfos**, we use pieces of information, like the name, the profile picture, the bio and the links.
	* in **userShots**, we can find every shots published by the owner of the dribbble account, and we can use it directly with ejs by **looping** on it and getting the information needed, such as the ID, the title, the description, images, and tags.
	
* **html information**

We use them with ejs within these tags : 
```<%- information %>```

and depending whereas they are links (images) or plain text, we just put those into the right html tag like this:
```
<p> <%- text_information %> </p>

<img src="<%- image_information %>">

```

* **css information**

what we mean by 'css information' is every values that we put in dribbble, which can be interpreted by css, for exemple a text-size, a background-color etc...

the way we use this is really easy. In the 'commonHead' ejs file, which is loaded in each page, we set a style tag like this :

```
<style>
	:root {

		--custom-loader-background-color: <%- parsed_setting_desc.loader_bgcolor[0] %>;
		--custom-title-font: <%- parsed_setting_desc.font_name[0] %>;
		--custom-p-font: <%- parsed_setting_desc.font_name[1] %>;

		--custom-background-image: url('<%- parsed_setting_desc.background_image[0] %>');
		--custom-background-repeat: <%- parsed_setting_desc.background_repeat %>;
		--custom-background-position: <%- parsed_setting_desc.background_position %>;
		--custom-background-attachment: <%- parsed_setting_desc.background_attachment %>;
		--custom-background-size: <%- parsed_setting_desc.background_size %>;

		--custom-h1-size: <%- parsed_setting_desc.h1[1] %>;
		--custom-h1-responsive-size: calc(var(--custom-h1-size) * <%- parsed_setting_desc.h1[4] %>);

		...

		}
</style>
```

Due to the fact that it's located in the root, those variables are accessible in each file, anytime.
This way we just need to set the right variable, at the right spot:

```
h1{
    font-size: var(--custom-h1-size);
    font-weight: var(--custom-h1-weight);
    color: var(--custom-h1-color);
    letter-spacing: var(--custom-h1-letter-spacing);
}
```

As we have a lot of css variables, each portfolio is completely different and customizable.
